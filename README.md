# Bootstrap Workshop

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand that Bootstrap is a framework for rapid and easy web page creation.
- Understand what responsive design is and how Bootstrap helps achieve it.
- Use Bootstrap to create a responsive web page

## Overview
Within this repo is an ugly and boring web page for a certain food delivery service. Your job is to use Bootstrap to make the page better structured, responsive and more *aesthetically pleasing*.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo using `git clone <repo url>`
2. Add Bootstrap to `order.html` by adding the following code within the `<head>` tags:

```
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- jQuery library -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

## Challenge
Make the web page look nice. You can do what you like, but here are some recommendations:
- Split the page into two columns, with the logo on one side and the form on the other
- Convert the list of links at the top to a navigation bar
- Use Bootstrap's form and button options to create a better form.
